# Titanic Survivor Estimator(Logistic Regression): Project Overview
- Predicting who survived or deceased with using Logistic Regression machine learning model
- I completed this project with what I learned from this course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/
